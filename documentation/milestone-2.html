        <div>
            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>A header section with a welcome message.
                A name I'll still need to come up with for my jewelry.
                Brief description/tag line for the jewelry. A stretch goal would
                quick links to specific parts of the page, such as the gallery
                or contact section.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Portfolio/Gallery: </h1>
            <p>Animated, responsive gallery of photos of different pieces,
                mimics a museum or gallery feel, styled with informational
                cards detailing key features and some process notes alongside.
                I want a responsive hover event for a subtle backlight or shadow
                effect when the user hovers their mouse over an image. Possibly a
                similar effect on the description placards.
                The look will be elegant, but warm and personal, with light,
                minimalist gothic aesthetics. This section will take up the majority
                of the page.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Contact/My links:</h1>
            <p>A contact form for people to reach out with questions or requests,
                along with links to my email, professional sites
                such as indeed and linked in, and my portfolio on ArtStation,
                icons that link to those sites. A personal photo at the bottom.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <footer>A neat, closing footer section to add balance to the page.
                    Maybe with some kind of closing message, like thank you
            for visiting.</footer>
